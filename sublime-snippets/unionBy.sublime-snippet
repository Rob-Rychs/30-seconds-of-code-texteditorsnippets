	<description>Returns every element that exists in any of the two arrays once, after applying the provided function to each array element of both.  Create a `Set` by applying all `fn` to all values of `a`. Create a `Set` from `a` and all elements in `b` whose value, after applying `fn` does not match a value in the previously created set. Return the last set converted to an array.</description>
